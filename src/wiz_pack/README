Quick and dirty readme.

A WRP file is a 512 byte header + romfs payload + 512 byte zero padding.

The WRP header contains three important fields that need to be modified when 
rebuilding a firmware. They are 

* An MD5 sum of the whole image with space for the sum to be inserted, filled 
with zeros. 

* The length of the romfs image.

* An MD5 sum of the romfs image.

I decided to make this little loader after forgetting to adjust the length
field and almost bricking my unit.

I've only tested it on my PPC Mac but it seems to work well with my S1.

Enjoy.
